# Mathematical Precision in The Edison

The Edison leverages advanced mathematical algorithms to ensure pixel-perfect formatting across different document platforms including Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and PDF formats.

## Unit Conversion System

The Edison maintains precise measurements through a comprehensive unit conversion system:

| Unit | Conversion Factor to Points |
|------|------------------------------|
| Inch | 72 points                    |
| Millimeter | 2.83465 points          |
| Pixel (96 DPI) | 0.75 points         |
| Pica | 12 points                    |

## Margin Calculation

The system uses symbolic mathematics to calculate optimal margins that ensure readability. For example, to achieve the optimal line length of 66 characters per line (recommended by typographers), The Edison solves the following equation:

```
Page Width - 2x = Characters × Average Character Width
```

Where:
- x is the left/right margin (in points)
- Average Character Width = Font Size × 0.6

## Typography Formulas

### Line Spacing

The Edison calculates line spacing using:

```
Line Height = Font Size × Line Spacing Multiplier
```

For double spacing in a 12pt font:
```
12pt × 2 = 24pt line height
```

### Characters Per Line

```
Characters Per Line = Content Width ÷ Average Character Width
Content Width = Page Width - (Left Margin + Right Margin)
```

### Paragraph Spacing

Mathematical relationship between paragraph spacing and line spacing:
```
Paragraph Spacing = Line Height × Spacing Multiplier
```

## Page Layout Algorithms

### Document Density

```
Document Density = Total Characters ÷ (Page Width × Page Height)
```

### Line Break Optimizer

The Edison uses dynamic programming algorithms to calculate optimal line breaks that minimize:
- Uneven line lengths
- Excessive hyphenation
- Widows and orphans

## Format Compatibility Matrix

The mathematical precision enables near-perfect format translation between platforms:

## Style-Specific Mathematical Constraints

### MLA Format

- 1-inch margins (72 points) on all sides
- Double spacing throughout (line height = 2 × font size)
- Header position: 0.5 inches (36 points) from top edge
- Page number: Right-aligned, 0.5 inches from top edge

### APA Format

- 1-inch margins (72 points) on all sides
- Double spacing throughout (line height = 2 × font size)
- Running head: Left-aligned, 0.5 inches from top edge
- Page number: Right-aligned, 0.5 inches from top edge
- Abstract: Position at 3 inches (216 points) from top of page

### Chicago Format

- 1-inch margins (72 points) on all sides
- Double spacing for text body (can be 1.5 for notes)
- Block quotes: Left margin + 0.5 inches (36 points)
- Page number position:
  - First pages of chapters: Bottom center, 0.75 inches (54 points) from bottom
  - Other pages: Top right, 0.5 inches (36 points) from top
